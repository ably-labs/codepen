    The demo renders SVG shapes in realtime with low latency
    messaging. Simultaneous users can participate by exchanging shape
    coordinates, so share the link with a friend or open multiple browser
    tabs and watch the magic happen.

    <p>
    Each click generates a shape and sends its characteristics to all
    connected users. To achieve this, we send messages over an Ably
    realtime channel with "rewind" enabled, which replays the last few
    messages on an active channel.
