# Ably SVG Shape Shifter

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ablyrealtime/pen/LYZmJpQ](https://codepen.io/ablyrealtime/pen/LYZmJpQ).

Open this pen multiple times and click on the canvas to generate a shape. On each of the other browsers that shape will appear as a ghost of itself.

We use an Ably realtime channel to shape share,  sending the coordinates and  SVG attributes to connected clients,  and persist recent activity with the channel rewind feature.
